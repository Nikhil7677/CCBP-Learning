###Description summary (exact as in page):

# Write a program that returns True if both the numbers 
# M
# M and 
# N
# N are greater than 100 and 
# M
# M is less than 
# N
# N. Otherwise, return False.

# Input:

# The first line contains integer 
# M
# M

# The second line contains integer 
# N
# N

# Output:

# Print a single boolean: True if both are greater than 100 and 
# M
# <
# N
# M<N; otherwise False.
